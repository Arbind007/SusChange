      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the
        present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
        their own needs. Sustainable development has continued to evolve as that
        of protecting the world’s resources while its true agenda is to control
        the world’s resources. Environmentally sustainable economic growth
        refers to economic development that meets the needs of all without
        leaving future generations with fewer natural resources than those we
        enjoy today.

      <h3>Importance</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The essence of this form of development is a stable relationship between
        human activities and the natural world, which does not diminish the
        prospects for future generations to enjoy a quality of life at least as
        good as our own. The idea of environmentally sustainable economic growth
        is not new. Many cultures over the course of human history have
        recognized the need for harmony between the environment, society and
        economy. The ‘environmentally sustainable economic growth’ is synonym to
        the prevalent concept of ‘Sustainable Development’. The goal of which is
        to achieve balance/harmony between environment sustainability, economic
        sustainability and socio-political sustainability.
